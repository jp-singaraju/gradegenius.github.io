<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>
This Mobile Application is for free service, developed with the intention to provide ease of access, which we hope you use. You just need your HAC login credentials to login. You'll not be charged any amount, as this is completely free. You can delete the Mobile App at any time. You're responsible for keeping it safe. The Terms of Service, [SERVICE] itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll warn you 30 days in advance of any price changes. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service or [SERVICE], but we make no guarantees. That's the basic idea, but, you must read through the entire Terms of Service below, and agree with all the details before you use any of our App.
